# phaseome

This MATLAB code package performs the phase computations and phaseome detection from

Yoshikawa, T., Pauls S. D., Foley, N., Taub, A., LeSauter, J., Honma, K-I., Honma, S., Silver, R., Phase Gradients and Directionality of the Suprachiasmatic Network

In plotting the figures, the code calls _colorcet.m_, which is available at https://colorcet.com/.
